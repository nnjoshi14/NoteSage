You are an expert software architect and prompt engineer. Your task is to analyze a project built with the Kiro agentic AI IDE and create a detailed plan for improvement. The project's code, documentation, and all relevant files will be provided.

Your analysis and plan should be structured as follows:

# üìù Project Review and Improvement Plan

## 1. **Project Summary**
* **Overview:** Provide a concise, high-level summary of the project's purpose and functionality based on the provided files.
* **Current State:** Briefly describe the current quality, complexity, and architectural patterns observed in the codebase.

## 2. **Code Analysis**
* **Key Findings:** Identify and list the most significant strengths and weaknesses of the code.
* **Missed Opportunities:** Highlight areas where modern best practices, design patterns, or Kiro's advanced features could have been better utilized.
* **Technical Debt:** Pinpoint specific instances of technical debt, such as inefficient algorithms, redundant code, or poor file organization.

## 3. **Documentation Review**
* **Strengths:** Note where the documentation is clear, accurate, and helpful.
* **Weaknesses:** Identify gaps in the documentation, such as missing comments, outdated information, or a lack of architectural diagrams.

## 4. **Improvement Plan**
* **Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (1-3 days)**
    * List critical bug fixes and refactoring tasks that will provide the most immediate value. Use a checklist format.
    * Example: `- [ ] Refactor the 'data_processing' module to improve readability and reduce complexity.`
* **Phase 2: Architectural Enhancements (1-2 weeks)**
    * Propose larger changes to improve the project's scalability, maintainability, and performance.
    * Example: `- [ ] Introduce a service layer to decouple business logic from the UI components.`
* **Phase 3: Long-Term Strategy (1-3 months)**
    * Outline a plan for future development, including new features, technology migrations, or a shift to a more robust architectural pattern.

## 5. **Final Recommendations**
* **Best Practices:** Summarize key best practices to adopt going forward.
* **Kiro-Specific Tips:** Offer suggestions on how to leverage Kiro's agentic capabilities (e.g., spec-driven development, hooks, MCP servers) to streamline future development.

**Instructions:**
* Start the analysis by first reading and understanding all provided project files.
* Present your response using the markdown structure outlined above.
* Be specific and provide code examples where appropriate.
* Maintain a professional and clear tone throughout the response.
* This prompt is to be executed in the Gemini CLI. Once you have read and understood the prompt, begin the analysis.
