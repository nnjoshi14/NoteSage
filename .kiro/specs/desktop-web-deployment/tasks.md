# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the NoteSage desktop application and server development into discrete, manageable coding tasks. The plan follows a test-driven approach with incremental progress, ensuring each step builds on previous work and results in integrated, working functionality.

The implementation is divided into two main tracks that can be developed in parallel:

## Development Notes

### Parallel Development Strategy
- **Server Track** (Tasks 1-10, 21, 23): Can be developed independently
- **Desktop Client Track** (Tasks 11-20, 22): Depends on server API completion
- **Integration Points**: Tasks 12-13 require server authentication API (Task 3)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each task includes component-level testing
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints tested with real database
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full user workflows tested across client-server
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for multi-user scenarios

### Technology Stack Validation
- **Server**: Go 1.21+, Gin/Echo, GORM, PostgreSQL/SQLite
- **Desktop**: Electron 28+, React 18+, TypeScript 5+, TipTap editor
- **Testing**: Testify (Go), Jest (TypeScript), Playwright (E2E)

### Risk Mitigation
- **Complex Features**: AI integration and real-time collaboration have fallback modes
- **Platform Dependencies**: Ubuntu focus reduces platform complexity
- **Database Migrations**: Comprehensive backup and rollback procedures
- **Security**: JWT tokens, secure storage, input validation throughout
